The Battlefield</p> <p>Any flat area can become a suitable battlefield with the addition of some terrain. Typically, a game of Legions Imperialis is fought on a 5' x 4' battlefield, however smaller games can be fought on smaller tables.</p> <p>\u20032. Terrain</p> <p>Games of Legions Imperialis are improved by the inclusion of terrain, such as the modular Manufactorum Imperialis, and Civitas Imperialis buildings and ruins sets. A variety of rules are included within the Terrain section of this book (see page 66) that allow players to use a wide variety of different terrain pieces on the battlefield.</p> <p>\u20033. Models</p> <p>Models are the core of Legions Imperialis, representing the armies that fought during the Horus Heresy. Each player will need a set of miniatures to represent their armies on the battlefield. The addition of more models increases the size and scope of the battles, with the average Legions Imperialis game seeing 2,500-3,000 points per player - see page 126 for more details.</p> <p>\u20034. Dice</p> <p>Legions Imperialis uses dice, primarily D6, to resolve most aspects of the game - see page 33 for more details.</p> <p>\u20035. Rulebook</p> <p>The book in your hands. Within, you'll find all the rules you need to play a game of Legions Imperialis, including the core rules (see page 32) , Missions (see page 104) and Army Lists and datasheets (see page 126).</p> <p>\u20036. Reference Sheets</p> <p>A reference sheet which allows players to easily look up the most commonly used rules and tables for Legions Imperialis mid-game.</p> <p>\u20037. Blast and Flame Templates</p> <p>These templates represent massive explosions, energy blasts and gouts of flame, and are used with weapons that have certain Traits - see page 77 for more details.</p> <p>\u20038. Range Ruler</p> <p>At various points, players will be called upon to measure distances, such as when moving a model or measuring the range of a weapon. A Range Ruler is a handy tool for doing that, though players can use any measuring tool they wish, such as a tape measure.</p> <p>Legions Imperialis takes place during the Horus Heresy, where the Imperium of Mankind was plunged into civil war by the actions of Horus Lupercal, favoured son of the Emperor. Games of Legions Imperialis are epic confrontations, fought between vast armies ranging from the line troops of the Legiones Astartes to the towering god-engines of the Collegia Titanica. Each player will assemble their own armies of detailed Citadel miniatures and take to the battlefield for glory and for victory.</p>"},{"location":"factions/","title":"Factions","text":""},{"location":"factions/#the-legiones-astartes","title":"The Legiones Astartes","text":""},{"location":"factions/#the-solar-auxilia","title":"The Solar Auxilia","text":""},{"location":"factions/#strategic-assets","title":"Strategic Assets","text":""},{"location":"factions/#the-collegia-titanica","title":"The Collegia Titanica","text":""},{"location":"factions/#the-questoris-familia","title":"The Questoris Familia","text":""},{"location":"factions/#mechanicum-taghmata","title":"Mechanicum Taghmata","text":""},{"location":"factions/#dark-mechanicum","title":"Dark Mechanicum","text":""},{"location":"factions/dark_mechanicum/","title":"Dark Mechanicum","text":"<p>The following section presents the Dark Mechanicum Army List, representing the forces of a Forge World that has cast off many of the old ways in favour of exploiting the proscribed knowledge gifted to them by the Warmaster.

Mightiest of them all, however, were the god- engines of the Collegia Titanica, a singular martial class within, and simultaneously quite distinct from, the ranks of the Cult Mechanicus.</p> <p>The towering bipedal god-engines known as 'titans' have served the Tech-Priests of Mars since the time referred to only as the Era of Pathogenesis. Though little data survives, it is known that titans first appeared during a great and terrible war fought between the besieged forges of the nascent Mechanicum and a debased caste of cabalistic heretics named the Cy-Carnivora. Vast swathes of the blasted red wastes of Mars had fallen to the Cy-Carnivora Mekwrights, and it took the creation of three entire Legios of what would become the Collegia Titanica to defeat them. These three Legios were collectively named the 'Triad Ferrum Morgulus', and it was from the template of their creation that all future Titan Legions were founded.</p> <p>Created to defeat the monstrous hunger-engines of the Cy-Carnivora, little could stand before a titan, and nothing before an entire Legios, which at its height might number between 200-300 towering machines of destruction. Having finally driven the horrors of Old Night from Mars, the Titan Legios were frequently fielded in the service of one forge against another in a series of internecine civil wars and schisms, seeding enmities that would bear bitter fruit indeed in the dark age to come. When the Emperor came to Mars and the accords were sworn at Olympus Mons, the Titan Legios were turned to the service of the Great Crusade, where their devastating weaponry, impregnable armour and the peerless skill and devotion of their crews proved every bit as destructive against recalcitrant empires and xenos horrors as they had against the Cy-Carnivora.</p> <p>By the height of the Great Crusade, scores of Titan Legios marched to war, each one a hammer the Imperium unleashed when a foe was deemed unworthy of quarter. The Collegia Titanica on Mars served as overall repository for the martial traditions and templates of the Legios, though in reality each was in effect its own master. By the auspices of the Collegia Titanica, each Legio assumed its own title, including High Gothic and Low Gothic monikers, icons, banners, colours and other unique elements of heraldry. When the Warmaster dragged the Imperium into civil war, the Collegia Titanica was not spared disunity.</p> <p>Across the galaxy, Titan Legion turned upon Titan Legion, and the galaxy quaked beneath their tread. Innumerable worlds were burned to ash beneath the wrath of warring god-engines and by war's end entire Legios had been rendered extinct, the loyal enshrined forever as heroes, the disloyal struck from the records to fade from memory.</p> <p>The following section presents the Collegia Titanica Army List, representing a Titan Legion deploying a demi-Legio or greater strength of titans to the battlefield, supported by Knight Banners.

Smaller and lighter than the god-machines of the Collegia Titanica, knights were nonetheless mighty creations of the Omnissiah. A single knight was capable of delivering enough firepower to annihilate an infantry platoon in an instant, and possessed of sufficient might, speed and skill at arms to bring down larger foes unaided. Each one was piloted by a noble warrior, a veteran of many campaigns and skilled in the arts of war. Rare was it for more than a handful of knights from the same Household to be deployed to a single theatre of war, and by the later years of the Great Crusade many a House had scions scattered across dozens of fleets, returning home after years, or even decades, replete with tales of honour and glory.</p> <p>During the terrible wars of the Horus Heresy, it became far more commonplace for a Household to march to war arrayed in full, the very earth trembling beneath the march of serried engines. When the Warmaster rebelled, many Knightly Houses rallied to his banner even as others drew their ranks tight in defence of their Emperor and his hard-won domain. For a Knight Scion, an enemy Household was the ultimate foe, a true test of might and skill that would earn the victor great honours;</p> <p>the Horus Heresy was the crucible in which the greatest of Households would emerge triumphant. As before, Knight Banners marched in step with the Legiones Astartes and Imperial Army, or assumed the mantle of Freeblade in search of personal honour, while other Households recalled their scions home. As one, such Knight Houses would often operate as independent forces, possessing the strength to challenge even the might of the god-engines of the Collegia Titanica.</p> <p>Amassed in number, a Household marched with tremendous fanfare of blaring warhorns and bright heraldry. In battle, massed firepower was employed from numerous vectors, relying upon the speed and power of the knight amours to overwhelm even the might of the god-engines of the Collegia Titanica.</p> <p>Questoris knights formed the core of a Household force, marching into the guns of the enemy with ion shields raised. Acastus knights unleashed volleys to break open fortified positions and obliterate armoured columns, while fast-moving banners of Cerastus armours swept down upon the foes' flanks. Such a force was one of total destruction, descending upon the enemy with murderous purpose, devoid of mercy. When the battle was won, the Household would march on, scouring the planet clean of any who would oppose them before taking to the stars once more, a blade to carve through the heavens.</p> <p>The following section presents the Knight Household Army List, representing a Household arrayed for war in significant numbers.

You can find out more about Expansions on page 77. This book contains two different campaign formats.</p> <p>The first format is the Warfront campaign on page 70. This is a very simple format in which players fight battles over a number of Campaign Cycles, with the side with the greatest number of Campaign Points at the end of the final Campaign Cycle being declared victorious. This campaign can be played with any number of players, but we recommend a maximum of eight.</p> <p>The second format presented in this book is the Conquest campaign on page 71. This format uses a map which the players battle over, either going on the offensive or defending territories on that map until one side has reached a target number of Campaign Points and is declared the winner. The campaign presented in this book is for six players, but a larger or smaller map for more or fewer players can also be created.</p> <p>The second format presented in this book is the Breakthrough campaign on page 60. This format uses a map which the players will battle over, pushing the opposing forces back towards their stronghold before laying siege to it and either emerging victorious, or seeing their own forces driven back. The campaign presented in this book is for six players, but a larger or smaller map for more or fewer players can also be created.</p> <p>The second format presented in this book is the Escalation campaign on page 65. This format uses a series of Campaign Cycles during which players fight with increasingly larger armies, with a Flashpoint - a battle which can change the direction of the war - at the end of each Cycle. Escalation campaigns culminate in a Grand Clash, a battle involving every player in the campaign.</p>"},{"location":"legions_imperialis_campaigns/additional_missions/","title":"Additional Missions","text":"<p>In this section you will find a series of asymmetrical Missions intended for use in a Legions Imperialis campaign.

In the Horus Heresy, names such as the Dropsite Massacre, the Burning of Prospero, the Battle of Yarant, the Battle of Calth and, of course, the Siege of Terra, are just some of the defining moments that altered the path of history. They represent the moment where bitter foes clashed in epic battle to decide the outcome of a world or a star system, or even the entire galaxy.</p> <p>The following section includes guidance and rules to help players conduct their own massive battle to function as the culmination of a campaign, the apex of the fighting that has led up to it. It also serves as a way to get everyone together for a final battle to celebrate the end of a campaign.</p> <p>Fighting a Grand Clash</p> <p>At the end of a campaign, players can agree to play a Grand Clash, a single campaign-defining battle involving every player; in cases where there are large numbers of players, two or more Grand Clash games can be fought instead.</p> <p>Fighting a Grand Clash requires a few modifications to the rules, with a distinction placed between a Faction - each group of players - and the individual players as follows:</p> <p>Points Limit</p> <p>The total points limit for each Faction is determined by the Campaign Master before the Grand Clash. A standard points limit is the points limit of the final campaign Cycle multiplied by the number of players in a Faction, but a different points limit can be chosen.</p> <p>Once the total Faction points limit has been determined, each player is then assigned a points limit for their Army. In general, all players within a Faction will have an equal amount of points, but an alternative method can be agreed otherwise. The total points limit of all players within a Faction must equal the Faction points limit.</p> <p>Faction General</p> <p>Each Faction should appoint a Faction General.</p> <p>During the battle, the Faction General will be in charge of rolling off for Initiative and deciding the order of events where relevant.</p> <p>Objectives</p> <p>Missions and Objectives are determined as normal, or a custom Mission is used as dictated by the Campaign Master - this could be a Flashpoint Mission, a Mission from another Legions Imperialis supplement or a Mission built from scratch.</p> <p>More players requires a larger battlefield. If using a Standard Mission or a Flashpoint Mission, the battlefield size can be modified in respect to the number of players fighting the battle. A good rule of thumb is to use one standard battlefield size per two players.</p> <p>For example, if four players were fighting in the Grand Clash, a 10'x4'battlefield would be used. If six players were fighting in the Grand Clash, a 15'x4' battlefield would be used, and so on.</p> <p>A larger battlefield also requires a modification of Objective markers placement. There are two ways of doing this. If the above method of increasing battlefield size relative to the number of players is used, then each 5'x4' section of the battlefield should have Objective markers set up as described in the Mission, resulting in a set of Objective markers per battlefield section.</p> <p>The second way is to modify the placement of Objective markers to fit the battlefield size; where there is equal distance between Objective markers, simply increase the distance required to keep these ratios and any distance between battlefield edges.</p> <p>For example, if the Grand Clash was fought using the Hold Ground Mission with a 15'x4' battlefield, the central Objective would still be the battlefield centre. The remaining Objective markers would be replaced 45\" from the short battlefield edges instead of 15\" (3x the length), but remain within 8\" of the players' battlefield edges.</p> <p>The Campaign Master can also add additional Objective markers as they deem necessary.</p> <p>Secondary Objectives</p> <p>Secondary Objectives are determined as normal, with each Faction having a single Secondary Objective rather than one for each player.</p> <p>Control the Battlefield</p> <p>The Control the Battlefield Secondary Objective is modified as follows:</p> <p>At the end of the battle, the battlefield is divided into 3'x2' sections; if there is any remaining space after doing so, the remaining space is its own section. Tactical Strength in each section is calculated as normal, with the player with the greatest Tactical Strength in a section being in control of it</p> <p>At the end of the battle, a Faction Scores:</p> <ul> <li> <p>5 VPs if players from their Faction control at least a quarter of the battlefield sections.</p> </li> <li> <p>10 VPs if players from their Faction control at least half of the battlefield sections.</p> </li> <li> <p>15 VPs if players from their Faction control at least three-quarters of the battlefield sections.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Playing the Game</p> <p>A Grand Clash uses the normal round sequence with the exception that when a player from a Faction is called upon to activate a Detachment, each player within the Faction activates a Detachment they control. Players within a Faction act simultaneously, with instances where the order of Detachment activation matters, such as which Detachment fires first, being determined by the Faction General.</p> <p>When determining who is in control of an Objective marker, the sum total of Tactical Strength for all models in a Faction is used to determine which Faction controls the Objective Marker.

Alternatively, the game might require more than one dice to be rolled and the results added together - in this instance, the rules will say 'roll 2D6', meaning roll two D6 and add the results together.</p> <p>D3: Sometimes, the rules call for a D3 to be rolled - in this instance, an actual three-sided dice is not necessary. Instead, roll a D6 and halve the result, rounding up to the nearest whole number (i.e., a 1 or 2 counts as a 1, a 3 or 4 counts as a 2, and a 5 or 6 counts as a 3).</p> <p>Scatter Dice: A Scatter dice is a six-sided dice that is used to determine random directions.

A dice can never be modified to 0 or lower, regardless of the modifier.</p> <p>If multiple modifiers apply at the same time, resolve any divisions and multiplications first, then any addition or subtraction. For example, if one rule says to double the result of a D6 roll, and another rule (which also applies) says to add 1 to the result, the D6 would be rolled, the result would be doubled and 1 would be added to the total.</p> <p>If a rule ever changes a result to a certain number, this overrides any modifiers unless otherwise stated.

If relevant, it will also include any special rules which apply to the battle and any restrictions on Army building.

It represents one of the countless planets and locales on which the catastrophic civil war was fought. Battlefields can range from apocalyptic visions of destruction, such as ruined cities or broken industrial complexes, to open wastelands wracked by radiation storms or verdant fields that will soon be scarred by the ravages of war. The planets of the galaxy are staggeringly diverse, meaning battles can be fought on any kind of battlefield you can imagine.</p> <p>In rules terms, the surface on which a game of Warhammer: The Horus Heresy - Legions Imperialis takes place is referred to as the 'battlefield', with each of its edges referred to as a 'battlefield edge'. Each deployment map will also highlight a battlefield edge, or part of one or more battlefield edges, for each deployment zone - this is the battlefield edge of the player who deploys in that deployment zone. In general, the rules and Missions of Legions Imperialis are written with a 5' x 4' battlefield in mind; some Missions might stipulate another battlefield size to use.</p> <p>Of course, players can use whatever sized battlefield they have available to them, be it smaller ones such as a kitchen table or a far larger one in a local gaming club upon which they can play massive battles. If players wish to play on a non-standard table size, then any measurements for factors such as deployment or objectives should be adjusted to reflect this.</p>"},{"location":"legions_imperialis_rules/fighting_a_battle/#battlefield-terrain","title":"Battlefield Terrain","text":"<p>There are few battles that take place over wide-open, featureless plains. Although games of Legions Imperialis can take place on battlefields without terrain, the addition of even just a few pieces makes for a much more interesting game. As part of the preparation for the battle, players will need to set up their battlefield terrain - this is always done before any Detachments are deployed on the battlefield and before players determine who deploys where.</p> <p>There are a variety of ways that terrain can be deployed on the battlefield:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Players can divide the table into quarters and deploy D3+1 areas of terrain in each quarter, with players taking turns deploying a piece of terrain, starting with the winner of a roll-off. For Structures, it is suggested that several individual Structures count as one area of terrain for the purposes of deploying terrain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Players can collaborate, placing various areas of terrain from those available to them to create an interesting battlefield.</p> </li> <li> <p>One player can set up the entire battlefield in a manner of their choosing. Then, when it comes to rolling to see who has control of the battlefield (see page 101), the player who did not set up the terrain automatically gains control of it.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Regardless of the method used, terrain should encourage tactical decisions and movement amongst armies. The addition of a cluster of Structures along with a few areas of Obstructing terrain and/or other line of sight blocking terrain will greatly influence the flow of battle, restricting avenues of movement and providing tactical advantages and disadvantages to Detachments.

As such, Matched Play is perfect for pick-up games in your local gaming store as well as for use in tournaments and leagues.</p> <p>A battle fought using the Matched Play rules is generally fought between two sides, most commonly with one player per side. Each player builds their Army to a points value agreed upon by the two players.</p> <p>The most common points value of an Army in Legions Imperialis is 3,000 points, and the rules have been written with this in mind. However, the rules are designed so points values can be scaled up or down, meaning players are free to determine the points value between them. The higher the points value of the armies, the longer a game will take. Battlefield size may also have to be adjusted; for games of 2,500 points or fewer, a 4' x 4' table is recommended, while a larger table might be required for higher points totals, such as a 6' x 4' table for games of more than 3,500 points.</p> <p>If one side includes more players than the other, then the total points value of both sides should be equal, meaning the side with more players will have fewer points to spend on each individual player's armies.

Two alternative examples are known as Open Play and Narrative Play.</p> <p>In Open Play, players simply pick what models they want to use, place them on the battlefield and have a good time playing against their opponent. In general, Open Play doesn't concern itself with the points values of armies, and the Mission is whatever players decide between themselves. In other words, the only restriction in Open Play is your own imagination.</p> <p>Narrative Play focuses on the story, taking inspiration from the rich background of the Horus Heresy. In the majority of cases for Narrative Play players will choose a Narrative Mission, which will list the point values for armies, deployment rules and victory conditions. These Missions will often place restrictions and guidelines on how players build their armies to better reflect the story the Mission is portraying. It is similar in many ways to Matched Play, but the key difference is that the tale is placed at the battle's heart - not every Narrative Mission will be fair, and sometimes one side or another will be outnumbered and/or outgunned. The Mission objectives will be tailored towards this, creating a thrilling game where players forge tales that will echo across the years. Players can, of course, design their own Narrative Missions, using the official examples as guidance.</p> <p>Regardless of what method of play you use, the purpose of Warhammer: The Horus Heresy - Legions Imperialis is for everyone to enjoy themselves - if that is happening, then you're on the right path.</p>"},{"location":"legions_imperialis_rules/fighting_a_battle/#selecting-a-mission","title":"Selecting a Mission","text":"<p>Once all players have assembled their armies, they will need to decide upon a Mission.

In general, larger Formations have a higher Break Point and are more advantageous on the battlefield.</p> <p>Formations represent the main building blocks of an Army; each Army must include a minimum of 1 Formation from its Primary Army List for each full 1,500 points of the agreed points limit for each Army (i.e., an Army assembled to a 3,000 points limit must include at least 2 Formations, a 4,500 point Army must include at least 3 Formations etc,.).</p> <p>Each Army List includes a number of Formations that are available to a player; future supplements may add additional Formations for various Army Lists.</p>"},{"location":"legions_imperialis_rules/mustering_an_army/#formation-organisation-charts","title":"Formation Organisation Charts","text":"<p>Each Formation is represented by a Formation Organisation chart - which Detachments a Formation can, or must, include are detailed there.

In the case of a Detachment Role, any Detachment from that Role can fill the slot; each datasheet has an icon which represents the relevant Detachment's Role, which informs which Detachments can be taken in which slots (see page 128 for more details on Detachment Roles).

All models in a Detachment must maintain Coherency and are activated at the same time, moving and attacking as a distinct group.</p> <p>All Armies will include a number of Detachment Roles, shown in the list that follows. A Detachment's Role will be denoted by the appropriate symbol in the Detachment's entry. Each Role represents a distinct type of asset available to an Army. Future supplements will add new Detachments to expand each Role, allowing you to field a variety of Detachments in various Roles.</p> <p> HQ Detachments: These are the leaders and generals of any army. Often few in number and with limited strategic weaponry, they rely on keen tactical acumen and special abilities to affect the flow of battle.</p> <p> Core Detachments: These warriors are the mainstay forces of an army, most often the foot soldiers that must weather the harshest fighting on the battlefield. Holding key objectives in the face of the enemy is the task that falls most often to these units.</p> <p> Support Detachments: Composed of specialised units intended to support the core of an army, Support Detachments take a variety of forms. Regardless of composition, they serve to eliminate key threats in the ranks of the enemy army.</p> <p> Bastion Detachments: Bastion Detachments include static weapon platforms, gun emplacements and units typically utilised in garrison forces. Designed to lock down portions of a battlefield with heavy firepower, they are often difficult to deploy in a timely manner.</p> <p> Vanguard Detachments: Vanguard Detachments represent the forward elements of an army, who strike fast and without mercy. Some are trained to range ahead of a marching army and secure key positions, while others form the tip of the spear, plunging directly into the enemy line to open the way for those that follow.</p> <p> Light Armour Detachments: Designed as support elements for ground forces, Light Armour is often fast and manoeuvrable. Their role is often to counter unexpected threats and provide heavy firepower in timely fashion</p> <p> Battle Tank Detachments: The mainstay armoured elements of a force. Extensively field tested, Battle Tanks are capable of responding to a myriad of threats and plunging into the thickest of fighting.</p> <p> Heavy Armour Detachments: The hammer that breaks open the toughest of foes, Heavy Armour represents many of the largest war machines within an army. Though often slow, they more than make up for it with weapons that can shatter battlelines in a single volley.</p> <p> Artillery Detachments: Covering both stationary and mobile long-ranged weaponry, Artillery Detachments are designed to soften up the enemy from a distance, relentlessly bombarding the enemy position in preparation of the main assault.</p> <p> Air Support Detachments: Air elements, both those stationed at local airfields and those on orbital ships, provide rapid close support to armies. Their role is to clear the skies of enemy aircraft and unleash destruction upon enemy ground troops.</p> <p> Transport Detachments: These special Detachments are composed of transport vehicles, and are attached to other Detachments to provide fast moving transport for slower infantry units. Unless instructed otherwise, Transport Detachments have a maximum Detachment size of 8 unless chosen as Dedicated Transports.</p> <p> Knight Detachments: Most commonly represented by the Knight armours of the Questoris Familia, Knight Detachments are technological marvels that can turn the tide of a battle.</p> <p> Titan Detachments: The god-engines of the Mechanicum frequently took to the field alongside the armies of both the Emperor and the Warmaster; as the war progressed, darker aberrations similar in power were also seen. Capable of sundering whole armies on their own, Titan Detachments represent the most powerful forces that can be mustered.</p> <p>Dedicated Transport Detachments</p> <p>Formation Organisation charts may include Transport sections, which will list any Transport options available for Detachments within the Formation. Transports purchased for a Detachment are referred to as Dedicated Transports. All Dedicated Transports purchased for a Detachment form a single Detachment but do not take up a Detachment slot within a Formation and so are not counted against the minimum or maximum number of Detachments within one.</p> <p>If a Detachment with Dedicated Transports is joined by another Detachment (such as one with the [Command] special rule) that has its own Dedicated Transport, the latter Dedicated Transport joins the Dedicated Transport Detachment - this can result in Detachments with different models (e.g., three Legion Rhinos and one Spartan Assault Vehicle). Detachments that have a Dedicated Transport with the Flyer special rule cannot join Dedicated Transports without the Flyer special rule.</p> <p>A Detachment must purchase the minimum number of Dedicated Transports needed to carry all models within the Detachment; it cannot purchase fewer, nor can it purchase more than necessary.</p> <p>For example, a Legion Tactical Detachment with a Detachment Size of 10 is upgraded with Legion Rhinos as Dedicated Transports. As a Rhino is Transport (2), meaning each Rhino can carry two models, the Legion Tactical Detachment must purchase 5 Rhinos; no more, no less.</p> <p>A Detachment can only purchase a Dedicated Transport if it is eligible to Embark upon that Transport.</p> <p>For example, if a Formation allows Legion Rhinos to be purchased as Dedicated Transports for Infantry Detachments in a Formation, a Legion Terminator Detachment cannot purchase a Rhino as, due to the Bulky special rule, it cannot Embark upon a Rhino.</p> <p>Dedicated Transports can only carry models from the Detachment they were purchased as an upgrade for. Dedicated Transports are ignored for the purposes of calculating Break Point.</p> <p>For example, a Formation with 26 models from HQ, Core or Support Detachments plus 10 models from Transport Detachments would have a Break Point of 13, not 18.</p> <p>Models with the Transport (X) special rule (or variation of) that fill a Transport Detachment slot are not Dedicated Transports; they function as a normal Detachment, and count towards the Break Point of the Formation. Any eligible Detachment with the Formation can Embark upon these Transports; models from outside the Formation or within an Allied Contingent cannot.</p>"},{"location":"legions_imperialis_rules/mustering_an_army/#complete-the-army","title":"Complete the Army","text":"<p>An Army must include the minimum number of Formations drawn from the Primary Army List, after which additional Formations can be added; the total points value of the Army cannot be greater than the agreed upon points limit.

This Formation is assembled in the normal way using Detachments from that Army List or the Strategic Assets list - Detachments from the Primary Army List cannot fill slots in an Allied Contingent.</p> <p>Each Allied Contingent in an Army can be drawn from a different list if the player wishes. The total points cost of all Detachments within Allied Contingents in an Army cannot be greater than 30% of the points limit of the Army. An Allied Contingent functions like any other Formation on the battlefield.</p> <p>For example, Owen is building a Legiones Astartes Army with a 3,000 points limit. As such, he must include a minimum of two Formations drawn from his Primary Army List - he chooses a Legion Demi-Company and a Legion Garrison Force.</p> <p>With the minimum Compulsory Formations filled, Owen can now include additional Formations drawn from the Legiones Astartes or Allied Contingents. Having assembled two Formations from his Primary Army List, Owen can include a maximum of two Allied Contingents.

This can be done by tying a Structure's Garrison Number to its size - the larger a building, the greater its GN. The size of Structure should be determined by the area of the battlefield it occupies.

Each player is a general, taking control of Detachments of finely detailed Citadel and Forge World miniatures ranging from infantry to the mighty god- engines of the Collegia Titanica.</p> <p>Its battles and campaigns take place in the same setting as some of Games Workshop's other ranges, most notably Warhammer: The Horus Heresy and Adeptus Titanicus: The Horus Heresy. Each offers a different experience within the expansive setting of the Horus Heresy, with Legions Imperialis reflecting the brutal majesty of the largest battles fought during the conflict. Engagements such as the Great Slaughter of Beta- Garmon, the Dropsite Massacre of Isstvan V, and the Siege of Terra itself are ideal backdrops for games of Legions Imperialis, allowing players to field expansive armies and fight epic battles, all in the space of a few short hours.</p> <p>This rulebook is only the beginning of your journey in Legions Imperialis.

Every effort has been made to retain the feeling of the original games while updating them with new mechanics and renewing them for a new era. For some readers, this rulebook will feel like an age come again.</p> <p>It also pays to note that Warhammer: The Horus Heresy - Legions Imperialis is just one of many games that take place within the Horus Heresy. The most obvious comparison is Warhammer: The Horus Heresy, with Legions Imperialis representing conflict on a grander scale.

Within you'll find all the rules needed to build a Legiones Astartes Army.</p> <p>Legiones Astartes Special Rules</p> <p>When building a Legiones Astartes Army, the following special rules apply. Some rules will mention Legiones Astartes Formations, Detachment and/or models - this refers to any Formation, Detachment or model drawn from the Legiones Astartes list, and not other Formations, Detachments and models that are part of the same Army only.</p> <p>When a player musters an Army using a Legiones Astartes Army List as the Primary Army List, that player must select a Legion for each Legiones Astartes Formation within it. The Formation is referred to as a [Legion Name] Formation and all Detachments and models within it are referred to as [Legion Name] Detachments or models. Detachment and models within that Formation may gain special rules associated with the chosen Legion (see page 154).</p> <p>No Formation, Detachment or model can benefit from more than one set of Legion rules. Different Formations within the same Legiones Astartes Army may be from different Legions.</p> <p>If Legiones Astartes Formations are included in a non- Legiones Astartes Army through Allied Contingents, then they too must choose a Legion and gain the special rules associated with it. All Legiones Astartes Allied Contingents within an Army must be drawn from the same Legion.</p> <p>For example, Tom selects the Legiones Astartes Army List as his Primary Army List, and chooses the Thousand Sons Legion for two of his Formations. As such, all Detachments within those Formations are referred to as Thousand Sons Formations, Detachments and models. If a third Formation is added and Tom decides they will be Dark Angels, then all Detachments within the Formation are referred to as Dark Angels Detachments.</p> <p>Certain Formations presented in future supplements may be exclusively available to certain Legions, and thus can only include models with that Legion special rule. Similarly, some Detachments might only be available to certain Legions, and thus can only be included in Formations of that Legion. Where this is the case it will always be clearly stated as part of the Detachment's datasheet.</p> <p>A player can declare their Formations are drawn from any Legion, regardless of the Army's Allegiance - though certain Legions sided with the Emperor or the Warmaster, it was not unknown for disparate elements to go against the will of their Primarch and choose a different path during the Horus Heresy. The only restrictions are units that are specifically Loyalist or Traitor (see the Loyalist and Traitors special rules in the Special Rules section).</p>"},{"location":"the_legiones_astartes/#legiones-astartes-tank-commanders","title":"Legiones Astartes Tank Commanders","text":"<p>Across the breadth of the Legiones Astartes, many talented and courageous commanders found their particular skills suited to armoured warfare. Some preferred a grand overview of the battlefield, coordinating entire phalanxes of tanks from an orbital strategium or command post. Others however took to the field, riding in the cupola of an armoured vehicle at the point of the spear. Often accompanied by a handpicked crew, these warriors led their brethren into battle with guns blazing, taking the fight to their foes and crushing them beneath churning tracks.</p> <p>In this section you will find new Detachments for Legiones Astartes armies, representing high ranking officers taking to the battlefield mounted in armoured vehicles. These Detachments can be made using standard vehicle models, but a Tank Commander should be clearly visible \u2013 this can be done through having an officer in the cupola, a small banner, an alternative paint scheme or similar identifiable method.</p> <p>Using These Detachments</p> <p>The Detachments found in this section are part of the Legiones Astartes Army List, as described in the Legions Imperialis Rulebook.

The amount the points cost is increased by is equal to the Engine Killer value of all weapons in that Detachment added together to form a single total, which is then multiplied by ten to determine the final points increase. Weapons which have the Engine Killer (X) special rule on a profile with a Range characteristic of '-' do not add to the total and are ignored when calculating the points increase of a Detachment.</p> <p>For example, Lee wishes to add a Detachment to their Army which contains a Reaver Battle Titan with a Reaver volcano cannon, a Reaver chainfist and a Reaver apocalypse missile launcher. The total Engine Killer value on weapons this model has (excluding the Reaver chainfist, since this has a Range characteristic of '-') is 3.
